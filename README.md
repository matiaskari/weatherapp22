# Weather application by Matias Kari

This project was made as a pre-assignment for a job application at Etteplan for the role of Junior Frontend Developer.

## How it works

This application fetches weather data from [https://openweathermap.org/](https://openweathermap.org/) and displays the weather of four cities in Finland: Espoo, Jyväskylä, Kuopio and Tampere.
The app diplays the current weather, as well as five future weather forecasts with an interval of 3 hours.

## How it's made

This application is made completely with React.js
It functions the best on a mobile device as the UI has been made primarily for that.

## How to run it

In order to run it yourself, locate the file './services/Weather.js' and insert your own free OpenWeatherMap API key as the value of the variable 'APIkey'.
Remember to keep the type of 'APIkey' as String by inserting your API key between the single quotation marks.
